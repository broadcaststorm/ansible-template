# Ansible Directory Template

I got tired of recreating the wheel and so created a simple template 
of an Ansible directory tree.  It's not complete and certainly might
require more work to substitute the contents for real configs and 
plays... but it's a start.

And it's just enough to remind me of syntax and typical constructs
I use to build a playbook - but since I don't do this often enough
I need a cheatsheet :)

Yes, there are a couple of these out there (some with GPL licensing!). 
I wanted my own stripped down version.
